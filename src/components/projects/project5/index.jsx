        <p  class="fw-normal h5">This is the loop() function that runs continuously while the ESP32 board is powered on. It first checks if there is any data available to be read from the Bluetooth module using the SerialBT.available() function. If there is data available, it is read using the SerialBT.read() function and stored in the c variable. If the data is '1', the LED is turned on using the digitalWrite() function and a message "LED on" is sent back to the app using the SerialBT.println() function. Similarly, if the data is '0', the LED is turned off and a message "LED off" is sent back to the app. The delay() function is used to ensure stability in the program.</p>
